# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

A project that makes a data analysis and creates a model for classification of cardiovascular disease.

## Dataset Information

## Context
> This context was created by Meigarom from [Be a Data Scientist](https://beadatascientist.com). So this is a totally fictional context.

Cardio Catch Diseases is a company that specializes in detecting heart disease in the early stages. Its business model is service type, that is, the company offers an early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease for a certain price.

Currently, the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is made manually by a team of specialists. The current accuracy of the diagnosis varies between 55% and 65%, due to the complexity of the diagnosis and also the fatigue of the team who take turns to minimize the risks. O custo de cada diagn√≥stico, incluindo os aparelhos e a folha de pagamento dos analistas, gira em torno de $ 1,000.00.

The price of the diagnosis, paid by the client, varies according to the precision achieved by the team of specialists, the client pays R$ 500.00 for every 5% accuracy above 50%. For example, for an accuracy of 55%, the diagnosis costs R$ 500.00 for the client, for an accuracy of 60%, the value is R$ 1000.00 and so on. If the diagnostic accuracy is 50%, the customer does not pay for it.

## Objective

Your objective as the Data Scientist hired by Cardio Catch Diseases is to create a tool that increases the accuracy of the diagnosis and that this accuracy is stable for all diagnoses.
